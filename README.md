# Password Protected Gravity Forms
Password Protect Gravity Forms on a Per-Form basis

## To Use
* Gravity Forms must be installed and active
* Upload this Plugin
* Build your form, and create a text field to act as your "password"
* Once saved, go to your form's settings
* Set the password, field ID, and validation message (if desired)

## Suggestions
* If using a comma separated list of passwords, you can set the field option "no duplicates" to prevent the same password from being used more than once.
* You can, on the text field, go to Advanced Options and choose "Enable Password Input" to mask what's entered
